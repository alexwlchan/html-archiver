    Test that the encoding is inferred correctly on marco.org.

    There was a bug (#15) where the page was read as Latin-1, even though
    the page had a <meta> tag specifying a UTF-8 charset.  This meant the
    permalink wouldn't render as an infinity-symbol, but as special chars.
    Check we do it correctly.
